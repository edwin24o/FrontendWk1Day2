                <h3>The Objective</h3>
                <p>Lower-body workouts are an important part of a well-rounded fitness routine that builds strength, flexibility, and balance. A well-developed lower body improves your resting metabolism, which means your body burns more fat during rest. Lower-body workouts also utilize several of your body's major muscles, burning more calories as it uses energy to finish them. Human growth hormone (HGH) is one of the hormones released when you exercise your legs. It is required for cell replication as well as the strengthening of muscles, bones, and tissues. Testosterone is another hormone that, in addition to being a masculine hormone, helps men and women build strong bones. It may even aid in the maintenance of normal brain activity. The overall objective is clear.. Longevity and to build mental fortitude! </p>
